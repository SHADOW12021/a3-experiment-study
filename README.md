## Our Experiment

[Intro / background]
We decided to recreate the experiment of Karen Schloss in [this paper](https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2791880). We explored the relationship between color and words, giving the user a series of word color pairs and asking them to use a slider to indicate the correlation between the two.

## Data Collection

We created a website using vanilla html, css, and javascript. We used a Node.js server and express to easily do routing. Upon the page loading, the user is given instructions and prompted to select a 'reward pathway', either cats or pokemon. To encourage users to spend more time on our application, we rewarded them with cats or pokemon as they did trials.

The user was then presented with a word and a colored square. The user uses a slider to indicate how correlated the word and color are, and then presses a 'next' button. When the user gets bored, they press 'end experiment' and the data is submitted to our mongoDB database.

## Achievements

### Design Achievements

For a design achievment, we created the reward pathways described above in the data collection section. These rewards were images of cats or pokemon and were not only fun, they also encouraged users to spend more time on our study.

### Technical Achievements

For our technical achievement, we did not use revisit. Instead, we created a website and a server using Node.js and express and connected that to a mongoDB database. The website was hosted (and the server ran) on [Render.com](render.com). Because the data was small and the webserver was simple, we were able to use the free tier of both services.
